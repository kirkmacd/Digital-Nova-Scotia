# DigitalNovaScotia
Hello everyone!  
Welcome to my Digital Nova Scotia Repo.  
This repo contains all of the notebooks, data, and scripts that will be covered in this session.  
Tools used in this session are pandas, plotly, and streamlit.
This session will be looking at data from IMDb (https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)
Movies.csv - General Movie Information
MoviesRatings.csv - Movie Rating Information
MovieSequels.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing data cleaning and visulizations
streamLitData.csv - Data for streamlit application
streamLitApp.py - Python script containing code for streamlit visulizations.

How to run streamLitApp.py?
Step 1: Open a cli (I use git bash as I am familiar with Bash)
Step 2: Navigate to the folder storing the streamlit py script (cd Documents/Git/Digital-Nova-Scotia/)
Step 3: Run py script ("C:\Users\macdk\anaconda3\python.exe" -m streamlit run streamlitapp.py)
